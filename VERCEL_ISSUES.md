# Vercel Deployment Known Issues and Solutions

## Current Issue: Admin Dashboard CRUD Operations Failing

### Problem Description
The admin dashboard shows "Error: Failed to delete product" (and similar errors for create/update operations) when deployed on Vercel. This is due to Vercel's serverless architecture limitations.

### Root Cause
Vercel serverless functions run in a **read-only filesystem**. Our application currently uses file-based storage (`content.json`) which requires write permissions to the filesystem. This works perfectly in local development but fails in production on Vercel.

### Error Messages You Might See
- "Error: Failed to delete product"
- "Error: Failed to create product" 
- "Error: Failed to update product"
- "Error: Failed to create collection"
- "Database write failed. This is a known Vercel limitation."
- "Read-only filesystem error on Vercel. File writes are not supported in production."

### Technical Details
- **Local Development**: ✅ Works fine (filesystem is writable)
- **Vercel Production**: ❌ Fails (filesystem is read-only)
- **Affected Operations**: All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Unaffected Features**: ✅ Public pages, portfolio display, image serving

## Solutions (Choose One)

### Solution 1: Use Vercel KV (Recommended - Quick Setup)
Vercel KV is a Redis-compatible key-value database perfect for small to medium applications.

**Cost**: Free tier includes 30,000 requests/month
**Setup Time**: ~15 minutes

#### Steps:
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project → Storage → Create KV Database
3. Connect it to your project
4. Replace file operations with KV operations in API routes

#### Code Example:
```typescript
import { kv } from '@vercel/kv';

// Instead of fs.writeFile
await kv.set('collections', data);

// Instead of fs.readFile  
const data = await kv.get('collections');
```

### Solution 2: Use PostgreSQL Database (Best for Scaling)
For a more robust, production-ready solution.

**Options**:
- **Vercel Postgres**: Integrated with Vercel
- **Supabase**: Free tier with generous limits
- **PlanetScale**: Serverless MySQL alternative
- **Railway**: Simple PostgreSQL hosting

#### Implementation:
1. Choose a provider and create a database
2. Add connection string to Vercel environment variables
3. Replace file operations with database queries
4. Use Prisma or similar ORM for easier database management

### Solution 3: External API/Headless CMS
Use a dedicated content management system.

**Options**:
- **Sanity**: Great for content management
- **Strapi**: Open-source headless CMS
- **Contentful**: Enterprise-grade CMS

## Quick Fix (Temporary)
If you need immediate testing, you can:

1. Deploy to a platform that supports file writes:
   - **Heroku** (supports filesystem writes)
   - **Railway** (full filesystem access)
   - **DigitalOcean App Platform**

2. Or run locally for admin operations:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Access admin at http://localhost:3000/admin
   ```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use the enhanced error messages to understand what's failing
2. **Short-term**: Set up Vercel KV for quick resolution
3. **Long-term**: Consider PostgreSQL for better data structure and relationships

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Fix CRUD)
- [ ] Choose database solution (Vercel KV or PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Update API routes to use database instead of file system
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations in production

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement user authentication for admin area
- [ ] Add image upload to cloud storage (Cloudinary/AWS S3)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Add data backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Implement admin user management
- [ ] Add analytics and monitoring

## Current Status
- ✅ **Public Website**: Fully functional on Vercel
- ✅ **Portfolio Pages**: Working correctly
- ✅ **Static Content**: All images and assets loading
- ✅ **Authentication**: NextAuth configured correctly
- ❌ **Admin CRUD**: Blocked by filesystem limitations
